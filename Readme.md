## Company Background
WeFit was founded by a group of Indian friends, Rohit and Anjali Shah, who were passionate
about fitness and wanted to create a supportive, welcoming community for people of all fitness
levels. They started out as a small gym or fitness studio in a bustling city neighborhood, offering
a variety of classes and training programs that were designed to be inclusive and accessible.
As the company grew, Rohit and Anjali decided to expand their offerings beyond just in-person
classes. They started to sell fitness gear, such as weights, exercise machines, and apparel, both
in-store and online. They also developed their own line of fitness apps, which were designed to
help users track their workouts, set goals, and connect with other members of the WeFit
community.
In addition to physical products and digital tools, WeFit also started to offer customized diet
plans, created by a team of nutritionists and dietitians. These plans were tailored to the specific
needs and goals of each customer, and could be integrated into their overall fitness routine. The
company also developed its own line of meal replacement products to be used as part of the diet
plans.
As WeFit's online presence grew, the company started to offer virtual classes and training
programs that could be accessed through their apps or website. These offerings became
particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were unable to attend
in-person fitness classes.
Over time, the WeFit brand became known for its high-quality fitness gear, apps, and customized
diet plans. The company built a loyal following among fitness enthusiasts, who trusted and relied
on the WeFit brand for all of their fitness needs. WeFit's success and popularity attracted the
attention of investors, and the company was able to secure funding from venture capitalists to
help it expand and scale its operations.
Thanks to its unique approach to fitness, strong brand, and successful business strategies,
WeFit became a unicorn company, achieving a valuation of over $1 billion. Rohit and Anjali were
thrilled to have built such a successful business, and they remained committed to their original
vision of creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all. They continued to innovate
and expand the company, always striving to help their customers achieve their fitness goals and
lead healthier, happier lives.
